            <h1>From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. The world became brighter, my heart felt lighter, and every day felt more meaningful because I had you by my side. You are my greatest joy, my safest place, and my most beautiful adventure.

Every heartbeat of mine whispers your name, every thought of mine carries you in it, and every dream of mine is painted with your love. You are the reason I smile a little wider, laugh a little louder, and love a little deeper.

On this special day, I just want you to know that you are my forever. No matter where life takes us, my heart will always find its way back to you. You are my home, my happiness, and my eternity.

With all my love, forever and always.</h1>
